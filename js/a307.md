  No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

  ```javascript
  const userList = [];
  userList.push('John'); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
  console.log(userList); // ['John']
  ```
