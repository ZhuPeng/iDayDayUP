  Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls in the program. It has two major actions,
  1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
  2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

  Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

  ```javascript
  function hungry() {
     eatFruits();
  }
  function eatFruits() {
     return "I'm eating fruits";
  }

  // Invoke the `hungry` function
  hungry();
  ```

  The above code  processed in a call stack as  below,
  1. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
  2. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
  3. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
  4. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.
