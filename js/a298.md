  JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

  ```javascript
  let age = 50;    // age is a number now
  age  = 'old'; // age is a string now
  age  = true;  // age is a boolean
  ```
