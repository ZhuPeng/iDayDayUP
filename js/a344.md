  The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

  ```javascript
  array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
  ```

  Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

  ```javascript
    var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
    var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
    var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
    console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears
  ```
