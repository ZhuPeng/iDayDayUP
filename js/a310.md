  In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

  ```javascript
  console.log('This is string sentence 1\n' +
  'This is string sentence 2');
  ```

  Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

  ```javascript
  console.log(`This is string sentence
  'This is string sentence 2`);
  ```
