  You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

  ```javascript
  const myArray = [false, null, 1,5, undefined]
  myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
  ```
