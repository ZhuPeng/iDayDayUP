  The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new

  ```javascript
  ( new Employee ).__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
  ( new Employee ).prototype === undefined;
  ```
