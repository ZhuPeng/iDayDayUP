  The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

  ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: 'John',
     printInfo: function () {
       console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
     }
   };

   const admin = Object.create(user);

   admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

   admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
  ```
