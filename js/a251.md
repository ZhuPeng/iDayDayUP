   TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

   ```typescript
   function greeting(name: string): string {
      return "Hello, " + name;
   }

   let user = "Sudheer";

   console.log(greeting(user));
   ```

   The greeting method allows only string type as argument.
