 A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

 The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

 ```javascript
     const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
       // promise description
     })
 ```

 The usage of a promise would be as below,

 ```javascript
 const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
   setTimeout(() => {
     resolve("I'm a Promise!");
   }, 5000);
 }, reject => {

 });

 promise.then(value => console.log(value));
 ```

 The action flow of a promise will be as below,
