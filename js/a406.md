  An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

  Let's take a below async function example,

  ```javascript
  async function logger() {

    let data = await fetch('http://someapi.com/users'); // pause until fetch returns
    console.log(data)
  }
  logger();
  ```

  It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.
