  The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function has finished executing the code.
  **Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.
