  A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
  Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,
  1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the ```<script>``` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
  2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
  3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue
