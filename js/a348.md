  Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

  ```javascript
  console.log(+ 'Hello');
  ```

  The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.
