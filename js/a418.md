  The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined insider constructor as below,

  ```javascript
  class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
  }
  ```

  But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

  ```javascript
  Person.staticAge = 30;
  Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;
  ```
