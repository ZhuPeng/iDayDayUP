  The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

  ```javascript
  const newObject = {};
  console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
  ```

  **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.
