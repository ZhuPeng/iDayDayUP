  Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.

  ```javascript
  const obj = { x: 1 };
  // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
  const { x: otherName } = obj;
  ```
