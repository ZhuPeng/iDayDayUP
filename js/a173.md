  The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statements.

  ```javascript
  var isAuthenticated = false;
  console.log(isAuthenticated ? 'Hello, welcome' : 'Sorry, you are not authenticated'); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
  ```
