 Promises have three states:
 1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
 2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
 3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.
