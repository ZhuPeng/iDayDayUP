  You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

  ```javascript
  class Square extends Rectangle {
    constructor(length) {
      super(length, length);
      this.name = 'Square';
    }

    get area() {
      return this.width * this.height;
    }

    set area(value) {
      this.area = value;
    }
  }
  ```
