  The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

  ```javascript
  switch (expression)
  {
      case value1:
          statement1;
          break;
      case value2:
          statement2;
          break;
      .
      .
      case valueN:
          statementN;
          break;
      default:
          statementDefault;
  }
  ```

  The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
