 Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. Let us take an example of unary function. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.

 ```javascript
 const unaryFunction = a => console.log (a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
 ```
