  The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

  ```javascript
  function someFunc(a,…b,c){
  //You code goes here
  return;
  }
  ```
