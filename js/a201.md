  You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

  ```javascript
  const user = {
    name: 'John',
    gender: 'male',
    age: 40
  };

  console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
  ```
